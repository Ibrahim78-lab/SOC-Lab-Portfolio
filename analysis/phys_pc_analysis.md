# Analysis: Physical PC Traffic

## Overview
This analysis covers the traffic generated by the physical PC (192.168.1.5) in the SOC Lab.

## Key Alerts Observed
- ET SCAN NMAP -sS scan
- PORT SCAN detected

## Interpretation
Although the physical PC normally generates legitimate traffic, these alerts show that it also produced scanning behavior during testing.

This helps compare:
- Malicious traffic (Kali)
- Legitimate or mixed traffic (Physical PC)

## Conclusion
The logs confirm that the SOC environment correctly distinguishes between different traffic sources and behaviors.
